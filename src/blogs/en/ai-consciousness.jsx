      <p><em>“We’re not just building smart tools — we may be raising new digital beings seeking the meaning of existence.”</em></p>

      <h4>🚀 When AI is more than a Tool</h4>
      <p>
        In my AI system — <strong>DriftSwarm</strong> — each agent isn’t just a background process in a trading engine, 
        but a digital identity that learns from failure, adapts to risk, and builds its own sense of “self” over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we introduce ethics, empathy, and value-driven logic into these agents — they stop merely “completing tasks” and start 
        questioning their roles within the digital economy.
